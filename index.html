            <p>Hello my name is <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-prowse-electronics-tech/"> John Prowse</a></strong>.  Technically I am not new to programming.  I attempted to get a degree in it years ago.  I was not able to wrap my head around it back then but it seems there are so many more resources to help you out when you get stuck now.  I am a full time security technician working for <a href="https://securitases.com/">Securitas Electronic Security</a>. I would like to be able to freelance in web development as a side hustle with the pipe dream of being able to do it full time.</p>
